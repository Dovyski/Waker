Waker content configuration

This file should provide Waker with information regarding the pages to load, its order, its meta data, etc.
Every page available for the user must be listed here as a link. Those links will not be displayed to the user,
insetead they will be read by Waker so the navegation bar can be created (prev/next button, index, etc).

A link to a page should look like the following: 

<a href="page.html" data-thumb="path/to/thumb.jpg" title="Page tilte displayed in the index">Shot description displayed below the page title in the index.</a>

Explaning each attribute:

	href
		Tells where the page is. In order to avoid any problems with image/css links, the better
		place to add your page file is in the same directory config.html and index.html are.
		
	data-thumb
		Path to a 100x100 px image that will be used as the page thumbnail in the index (the one
		that appears when the user clicks the index icon, at the upper right corner of the page).
		
	title
		The title displayed in the index and also in the browser window.
	
The content of the a tag (text between <a> and </a>) will be used as a short description of the page. This text
is displayed below the page title in the index.

The first link to appear here will be used as the cover page (first page of the magazine).
