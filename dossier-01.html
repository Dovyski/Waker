<!-- 

IMPORTANT: after you create any content page, you must add it to "config.html" file, otherwise the
page will not be displayed.


This is an ordinary content page.

Any content page must not include the complete HTML tags structure (<html>, <head>, <body>, etc). It is
supposed to have "pure" content, such as a set of paragraphs.

All content placed here will be loaded into a div in the index.html file. You are free to use
any html/css/javascript knowledge you have, but bear in mind that the content will be loaded into
a div.

Every content page can feature a headline image, which is displayed at the beggining of the content.
In order to specify a headline image, just add a common <img> tag with the class "img-headline". E.g.

		<img src="path/to/headline/img.jpg" class="img-headline" />

You can inform just one headline image per content page. If there are more than one, Waker will choose the last
one it found.

About the content layout, you can create a title using <h1></h1>, which is the text in bold displayed
at the beginning of the page, below the headline image. E.g.

	<h1>Embedding YouTube Videos, the card-flip effect and playing sound</h1>

All other text blocks should be wrapped by the following structure:

	<div class="large-column float-left">
	     <p>Morbi semper ultrices porta. Aenean dignissim, sapien eget sodales.</p>
	     <p>Donec molestie dui et nisl posuere volutpat rhoncus mauris porta.</p>
	</div>
	
Column types:

 * full-column
 * large-column
 * small-column

Column alignment:

 * float-left
 * float-right
 
Images alignment:

 * media-left
 * media-right

<h1>Waker: build HTML5 magazines!</h1>

<div class="full-column float-left">
     <p>Waker is a "web-only" version of <a href="https://github.com/ffranke/Laker-Compendium" target="_blank">Laker</a>, a compendium of files, frameworks, styles and tips for designing digital publications. Waker is fully based on HTML5 capabilities and can be used to create digital magazines (for tablets, smartphones, PCs, etc).</p>

<div class="full-column float-left">

	<p>Why the heck have you created another mobile magazine-like stuff if there are several projects out there such as <a href="https://github.com/ffranke/Laker-Compendium" target="_blank">Laker</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Simbul/baker" target="_blank">Laker</a>?</p>
	<p>Because I thought they could not (easily) do what I wanted to do. I decided to create an eletronic magazine for a Computer Science course, but it had to be available in a variety of forms: online/offline accessed by a desktop or mobile browser and offline as the content of a non-web app.</p>
	<p>I also needed something that allowed me to focus on the content itself, not its organization. I did not want to create all page links manually (navigation bar, index page, etc). I wanted minimum effort and maximum content propagation. I wanted something that were smooth in a browser and easily packagable as an app. <w:end/></p>
