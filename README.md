Waker
=================

Waker is a "web-only" version of Laker, a compendium of files, frameworks, styles and tips for designing digital publications. Waker is intended to be fully based on HTML5 capabilities.


Why? 
-----

Why the heck have you created another mobile magazine-like stuff if there are several projects out there such as [Laker](https://github.com/ffranke/Laker-Compendium) and [Baker](https://github.com/Simbul/baker)?

Because I thought they could not (easily) do what I wanted to do. I decided to create an eletronic magazine for a Computer Science course, but it had to be available in a variety of forms: online/offline accessed by a desktop or mobile browser and offline as the content of a non-web app. 

I also needed something that allowed me to focus on the content itself, not its organization. I did not want to create an index by hand linking all articles. I wanted minimum effort and maximum content propagation. I wanted something that were smooth in a browser and easily packagable as an app.
